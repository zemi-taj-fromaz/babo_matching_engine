/*
 * matching_engine_api.h — the matching-engine benchmark integration contract.
 *
 * Published with "The World's Fastest Matching Engine Algorithm"
 * (Flash One Technologies, 2026).
 *
 * An engine under test is built as a shared library (.so) that exports the
 * symbols below. The harness loads it with dlopen() and, by default, drives it
 * one message at a time; an engine that exports the optional engine_on_batch()
 * (documented later in this header) is instead handed a run of messages per
 * call.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Contract requirements
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  - The engine emits its own report stream. For every message the engine
 *    produces the reports it generates — OrderAck, Trade, CancelAck (including
 *    the cancellation of an IOC residual), ModifyAck, and CancelReject /
 *    ModifyReject for a cancel or modify of an order that is not resting — and
 *    pushes each into the report transport (see "Report transport" below). The
 *    harness does not synthesize reports; it only drains the stream the engine
 *    produces.
 *  - The engine may use threads. It can match on the calling thread or on its
 *    own thread(s), and report from whichever thread it likes — whatever
 *    reflects how it runs in production. There is no single-thread restriction.
 *  - engine_flush() is the pipeline barrier. After the harness has delivered
 *    the last message it calls engine_flush(); the call must not return until
 *    every message delivered so far has been fully matched and every resulting
 *    report has been pushed into the transport. engine_flush() is inside the
 *    measured window, so deferred work is always counted — an engine cannot
 *    appear fast by returning early and finishing after the clock stops.
 *  - engine_query_* must reflect every message delivered before the query call
 *    returns. For an engine that matches asynchronously the query is a
 *    synchronization point: it must observe all preceding messages.
 *  - Prices are signed integer ticks; one tick is $0.005 (SEC sub-penny rule).
 *  - Each Trade report carries the aggressive (incoming) order's
 *    sequence_number; the fill price is the maker's (resting order's) price.
 *
 * Modify is handled as cancel + reinsert: the order is removed and re-added at
 * its new price/quantity, losing queue (time) priority. Every modify in the
 * canonical workload is a reprice or a quantity increase, which production
 * exchanges handle exactly this way.
 *
 * See docs/INTEGRATION.md for a worked walkthrough and docs/METHODOLOGY.md for
 * the measurement protocol.

/* ===========================================================================
 * OPTIONAL: pre-build hook
 *
 * If exported, the harness calls engine_prebuild() once per workload message,
 * in dispatch order, BEFORE the timed window opens — letting the engine marshal
 * each message into its native order representation ahead of time. The timed
 * engine_on_* calls then dispatch the pre-built form, so the measured window is
 * matching work alone, not ABI-struct-to-native marshaling. msg_type is
 * 0 = new, 1 = cancel, 2 = modify; msg points to the matching new_order_t /
 * cancel_t / modify_t. An engine that does not export this converts inside
 * engine_on_* as usual.
 *
 * CONSTRAINT — translation only. engine_prebuild may ONLY marshal a message
 * into the engine's native order representation (and pre-size static capacity).
 * It must NOT insert into the book, match, allocate the resting order node, or
 * populate any id->handle map: that is matcher work and belongs in the timed
 * engine_on_* calls. The harness enforces this two ways: right after the
 * prebuild pass, before the clock starts, it asserts the book is empty
 * (engine_query_best_bid() == INT64_MIN and engine_query_best_ask() ==
 * INT64_MAX), catching pre-insertion; and it times the prebuild pass, flagging
 * (and, when egregious, gating INVALID) a prebuild that rivals the timed run —
 * the signature of matcher work hidden in a private shadow. See
 * docs/ANTI_CHEAT.md.
 * ===========================================================================*/

void engine_prebuild(uint8_t msg_type, const void* msg);

/* ===========================================================================
 * OPTIONAL: batch delivery
 *
 * If exported, the harness delivers the workload through engine_on_batch()
 * instead of the per-message engine_on_* calls: each call hands the engine a
 * run of `n` tagged messages to process. This exists for engines whose ABI
 * boundary is expensive to cross per call (e.g. a foreign-runtime matcher
 * reached through cgo/JNI, where each inbound call pays a runtime-entry cost);
 * delivering a run amortizes that fixed per-crossing cost over `n` messages. An
 * engine that does not export this is driven one message at a time as before.
 *
 * CONTRACT — process the run exactly as if each message had been delivered
 * alone, in array order, with NO cross-message lookahead. Message i must be
 * fully matched (and its reports pushed) before message i+1 is examined; the
 * engine may not peek at a later message to alter how it handles an earlier one
 * (e.g. net a new order against a cancel that appears later in the same batch).
 * Two harness mechanisms enforce this without trusting the engine: the report
 * stream must be byte-identical to per-message delivery (any lookahead changes
 * the emitted reports and fails the canonical hash), and — so the random-point
 * state audit keeps working — the harness ends a batch exactly at each audit
 * probe index, then calls engine_query_* before delivering the next batch, so
 * the book is inspected at the same unpredictable per-message points it would
 * be under one-at-a-time delivery (see docs/ANTI_CHEAT.md). engine_flush() is
 * still the final barrier.
